/*

Here's what happens behind the scenes when the new keyword is used:

A new object is created: The new keyword initiates the creation of a new JavaScript object.

A prototype is linked: The newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the constructor function. This means that it has access to properties and methods defined on the constructor's prototype.

The constructor is called: The constructor function is called with the specified arguments and this is bound to the newly created object. If no explicit return value is specified from the constructor, JavaScript assumes this, the newly created object, to be the intended return value.

The new object is returned: After the constructor function has been called, if it doesn't return a non-primitive value (object, array, function, etc.), the newly created object is returned.

//this means jis like current context and jis means all values of current context
// function,Array,string -> Object -> null
// function, array, string are object and object value is null like if you give power to object and inject any method in it then it will be accessible for all like func,array,string but if you give power or method to array then it will accessible for just array same goes for func and string 
// For example:
// let myHeros = ["thor", "spiderman"]

// In browser environment we have window as global and this = window and in node environment we have global this = {}   
// window = {this = window}
// node = {} 

// let heroPower = {
//     thor: "hammer",
//     spiderman: "sling",

//     getSpiderPower: function(){
//         console.log(`Spidy power is ${this.spiderman}`);
//     }
// }

// Object.prototype.hitesh = function(){
//     console.log(`hitesh is present in all objects`);
// }

// Array.prototype.heyHitesh = function(){
//     console.log(`Hitesh says hello`);
// }

// heroPower.hitesh()
// myHeros.hitesh()
// myHeros.heyHitesh() 
// heroPower.heyHitesh() //error
